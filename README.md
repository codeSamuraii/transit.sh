# [Transit.sh](https://transit.sh)
Direct file transfer in your terminal. No subscription, no storage, no additional tool needed.

Leveraging [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and [queues](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-queue.html), the API waits for the receiver to start downloading before accepting more incoming data.<br>

> The service is currently deployed as a proof-of-concept without any no guarantees. Access it [here](https://transit.sh).

## Usage

```bash
#Â Send
curl -T <file> https://transit.sh/<some-string>/

```bash
# Receive

```
